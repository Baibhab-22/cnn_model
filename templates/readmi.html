            # **Cotton Plant Disease Pridiction Deep Learning CNN Model**
        </h1>
        <h3>
            ## *Introduction* -:</h3>
        <p>
            Agriculture is the backbone of many countries in South Asia like Bangladesh, China, and India.Cotton is
            known as
            ‘white gold’ in the agricultural industry. Agriculture is the primary source of economic income in
            Bangladesh
            and the country’s economy is heavily dependent on agriculture. The soil and water resources of our country
            are
            fertile and the climate is moderate. But numerous diseases aﬀect crop production and cause enormous crop
            losses,
            endangering the lives of helpless farmers. A previous report showed that about 70–80% of cotton diseases
            were
            leaf diseases and 30–20% were pest diseases. Experts typically use bare eyes to ﬁnd and identify such plant
            diseases and pests which may result from lower accuracy of the identiﬁcation. As a result, early detection
            of
            cotton disease using AI-based systems may help to increase the production of cotton by detecting the leaf
            disease signiﬁcantly.

            So we use Deep Techniques for model building and provide a best accuracy of model for Agriculture domain.

            ## *Python Libraries use in this Project* -:</h3>
        <h4>
            Python Libraries-
        </h4>
        Numpy
        <br>
        Matplotlib
        <br>
        Keras
        <h4>
            For Deployment-</h4>
        Flask

        <h3>
            ## *Data Collection* -:</h3>
        <p>
            A data set containing images of fresh and diseased cotton leaf and plants are collected from Kaggle.com as
            part
            of a competition. This data set is comprised of four image types: fresh cotton leaf, fresh cotton plant,
            diseased cotton leaf and diseased cotton plant with unique images. For example, 2 and 3 represent the fresh
            and
            aﬀected samples of the dataset.
        </p>
        <h3>
            ## *Data Analysis and Preprocessing* -:</h3>
        <p>
            The real image of the dataset is not always fresh and hence may contain noise in the data. Before attempting
            to
            ﬁt them into the learning module, it is necessary to preprocess them for better accuracy and per-formance of
            the
            module. This refers to the process of preparing the data for further use, which may involve integrating,
            cleaning, normalization, or transforming the data. In our case, we apply the some types of operation -
            Resize,
            Rescaling, zooming etc.
        </p>
        <h3>
            ## *Model Building With Convolutional neural network (CNN) Model* -:</h3>
        <p>
            Train the data using CNN and apply the some tradisional features like resize, rescaling, or build a model
            with
            98% accuracy. Model will give perfect accuracy after increasing the number of epochs. We use maxpooling
            layers
            with each or affected position.You can see summary detail of model using model.summary function.The data has
            droped three times with building model at 0.2, 0.5, and 0.75.
        </p>
        <h3>
            ## *Model accuracy, Evaluation, or Test* -:</h3>
        Model is giving 98% accuracy with the better validation accuracy and
        tested confusion Matrix, classification report, precision or recall scores.
        <br>

            There is some parameter chenges for model building. <br>

        We plotted the Accuracy or Losses at Chart.

            ## *Deployment of the Project* -:</h3>

            This is a complete Project of cnn so we Deployed at heroku
            we use Flask Python library for backend.</p>
